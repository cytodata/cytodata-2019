![Boutros Lab](/./hosts_files/boutroslab.png)

The [Boutros Lab / Division of signaling and functional genomics](https://www.dkfz.de/en/signaling/index.php) is based at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Germany. We use genetic and genomic methods to link genotypes to phenotypes, and cell biological approaches to study specific processes and probe underlying mechanisms. Current research interests are:

* Systems genetics, chemical genetics and synthetic lethality in cancer cells

* Wnt signaling networks in development and cancer

* Experimental and computational approaches for high-throughput screening
